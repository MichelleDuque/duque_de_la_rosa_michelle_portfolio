# Portfolio

I am Michelle Paola Duque De La Rosa, I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia and now I am located in London, Ontario. I'm a passionate developer, my favorite one is Python, but I adore JavaScript, Java, and PHP; you know what I can't choose because I love learning new programming languages all the time.

Look through my portfolio to view the projects I have created. I like using code to make ideas come to life, whether they are for dynamic JavaScript creations or new Python applications.
