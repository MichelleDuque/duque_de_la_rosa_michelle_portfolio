# Michelle Duque De La Rosa - Portfolio

I am Michelle Paola Duque De La Rosa, I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia and now I am located in London, Ontario. I'm a passionate developer, my favorite one is Python, but I adore JavaScript, Java, and PHP; you know what I can't choose because I love learning new programming languages all the time.

👩‍💻 I focus on Front-end web development. I have extensive experience using HTML, CSS, and JS, and I also know the workflow of some Front-End frameworks like Next.js and React.
